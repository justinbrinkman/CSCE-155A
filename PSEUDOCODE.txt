Step 1: Declare constant <TOTAL_POINTS> to 2400
Step 2: Print "Welcome to the CSCE 155A Grade Calculator!"
	"You can calculate how many points you need on the final exam."
Step 3: Ask user to input his/her total homework points out of 600
Step 4: Assign user input to variable <homeworkPoints>
Step 5: Ask user to input his/her total lab points out of 600
Step 6: Assign user input to variable <labPoints>
Step 7: Ask user to input his/her total midterm points out of 600
Step 8: Assign user input to variable <midtermPoints>
Step 9: Ask user to input his/her total PRS exam points out of 100
Step 10: Assign user input to variable <prsPoints>
Step 11: Ask user to input his/her total extra credit points earned out of 250
Step 12: Assign user input to variable <extraCreditPoints>
Step 13: Assign variable <semesterPoints> to homeworkPoints + labPoints + midtermPoints + prsPoints + extraCreditPoints
Step 14: Print user's total homework grade as a percentage (homeworkPoints / 600.0) * 100%
Step 15: Print user's total lab grade as a percentage (labPoints / 600.0) * 100%
Step 16: Print user's total exam grade as a percentage ((midtermPoints + prsPoints) / 700.0) * 100%
Step 17: Print "Points needed on final to get <grade>" + (TOTAL_POINTS * <gradepct> - semesterPoints)
	 In accordance with:	<grade>	<gradepct>	for respective grade
				A+	0.9667
				A	0.9171
				A-	0.9004
				B+	0.8671
				B	0.8171
				B-	0.8004
				C+	0.7671
				C	0.7171
				C-	0.7004
				D+	0.6671
				D	0.6171
				D-	0.6004
				F	Below 0.6004				
Step 18: Print "Percent needed on final to get <grade>" + ((TOTAL_POINTS * <gradepct> - semesterPoints) / 400.0) * 100%
Step 19: Repeat steps 17-18 for each grade threshold
Step 20: Print "Good luck!"
